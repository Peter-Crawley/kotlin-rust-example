A basic example of how to configure a project consisting of a Kotlin Main class
which calls a Rust function.

This exists as a result of me messing around, I will probably use what I
learned with this with other projects in the future.

This requires Cargo with a Rust toolchain to be installed, actually building it
is handled by a quick line in Gradle.

The project is written for Linux, however it should be simple to adapt for
Windows by just changing ".so" to ".dll" in src/main/kotlin/Main.kt on line 8,
not sure though, have not tested it.
